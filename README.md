# EelEngineGdx #
A 2d game engine built on libgdx and artemis-odb.

More info on my portfolio [here](http://www.dubthink.com/#portfolio-1).

This project is the basis of a few game experiments. Perhaps the most interesting branch is sergei, a prototype game of a little robot that you script to control.
